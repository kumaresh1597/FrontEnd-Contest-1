    <p>
      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.

    <h1>Ordered List</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike
        men who are so beguiled
      </li>
      <li>
        Demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
        desire, that they cannot foresee the pain
      </li>
      <li>These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish</li>
      <li>
        In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when
        nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best
      </li>
      <li>
        The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle
        of selection
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Unordered List</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
        and praising pain was born
      </li>
      <li>
        I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
        teachings of the great explorer of the truth
      </li>
      <li>
        Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain
        of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
        occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure
      </li>
      <li>
        To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
        physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it
      </li>
      <li>
        But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a
        pleasure that has no annoying consequences
      </li>
    </ul>
